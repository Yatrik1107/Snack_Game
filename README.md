This is a simple snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a graphical user interface where players control a snake to eat food, increasing their score and the length of the snake as they play. The objective is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game window's boundaries.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Game Mechanics**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game window features background images, a score display, and colorful food and snake elements.
- **High Score Tracking**: The game tracks and saves the highest score in a `highscore.txt` file.
- **Sound Effects**: The game plays sound effects for eating food and game over scenarios.
- **Customizable Assets**: The game supports loading custom background images and sound files for a personalized experience.
- **Executable Version**: A standalone `.exe` file of the game has been generated for easy sharing and distribution.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
    - **Right Arrow**: Move right
    - **Left Arrow**: Move left
    - **Up Arrow**: Move up
    - **Down Arrow**: Move down
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats food, and your score will increase.
- Avoid collisions with the snake's own body or the edges of the game window, or it's game over.

## Game Assets
- **Background Images**: Located in the `Images/` folder. Custom images for the game screen, start screen, and game over screen.
- **Sounds**: Located in the `Sound/` folder. Sound effects for food consumption and game over events.
